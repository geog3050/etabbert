Repository Description

This repository is a location for me to save all my assignments, quizzes, and projects done during my time in GEOG 3050.
From here, you can view my progress in Python programming and how I integrated those skills into GIS using the Arcpy library.

About Me

I'm currently finishing up my senior year at the University of Iowa. 
I am studying geoinformatics. Previously, I studied computer science. 
I didn't feel like that major ticked all my boxes and I wanted to incorporate my interest in nature and geography. 
Geoinformatics is the perfect combination of geographic and computer science. 
After college, I am interested in pursuing a career in software development or GIS analysis.  
I think that the need for geographic information systems is on the rise and more businesses will see a need for it in the near future as we further integrate technology with our day to day lives. 
I am excited to graduate from the University of Iowa and start my career in geoinformatics.
